              CarModPicker is a hobbyist web application operated by an
              individual that lets users catalog cars, build lists, and parts,
              and share build logs. It is offered in active development and on a
              best-effort basis. Features may change or disappear without
              notice.

                taxes.

                Subscriptions renew automatically at the then-current rate at

                All fees are non-refundable except where required by law or

                refunds for partial periods or unused time.
              </li>
              <li>
                We may change fees, Paid Features, or billing terms at any time.
                Changes take effect at the start of your next billing period.
                Your continued use of a Paid Feature after the change is your
                agreement to the new terms.
