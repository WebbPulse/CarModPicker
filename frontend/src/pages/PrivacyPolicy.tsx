            </h2>
            <p>We collect only what is needed to run the Service:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Account information</strong> you provide: username,
                email address, hashed password, optional profile details, and
                two-factor authentication secrets if enabled.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Content you create</strong>: cars, build lists, parts,
                build logs, images you upload, votes, and comments. Items you
                submit privately — such as content reports to moderators and bug
                reports — are kept internal and are not displayed publicly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technical data</strong>: IP address, user agent,
                timestamps, and request logs used for security, rate limiting,
                and debugging.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cookies and local storage</strong>: a session token to
                keep you logged in, plus minimal preferences. We do not use
                tracking cookies of our own.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data from our Chrome extension</strong>: if you install
                our optional extension, it does <em>not</em> run in the
                background and does <em>not</em> passively track your browsing
                history. When — and only when — you click the extension's action
                button on a page, it captures that page's URL and its rendered
                HTML and sends them to our servers for parsing into product
                information. Before the HTML is stored or parsed, our servers
                remove scripts (other than product structured data), styles,
                iframes, and form field values so that autofilled inputs and
                inline user-state blobs are not retained. The extension does not
                read cookies, browser storage, or request headers.

              We do <strong>not</strong> guarantee any particular retention
              period for your data. The Service is in active development and is
              operated on a best-effort basis. We may, at any time and without
