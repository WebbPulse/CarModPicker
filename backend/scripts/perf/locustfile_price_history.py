"""Locust scenario for the price-history perf gate (M002/S05/T05).

Simulates the frontend's sparkline access pattern against two read endpoints:

- ``GET  /api/parts/{id}/price-history?window=90d`` (weight=4, dominant call)
- ``POST /api/parts/price-history``                  (weight=1, batch summary)

Part IDs are loaded from ``backend/.perf-runs/part-id-pool.json`` — the runner
script (run_price_history_loadtest.sh) generates that pool from the DB before
spawning users so every locust process sees the same pool without needing a
DB connection.

Budget enforced by the wrapper script (NOT here):
- GET p95 < 200 ms
- POST p95 < 500 ms
- error rate == 0

If the budget is missed the wrapper opens R036 (materialized part_price_summary)
per D004 — see backend/scripts/perf/README.md.
