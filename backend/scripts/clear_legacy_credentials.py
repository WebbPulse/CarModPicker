"""Remove the legacy `hashed_password` and `totp_secret` columns from user rows.

The far end of the identity migration, and the one step in it that cannot be
undone by reverting a deploy. `migrate_credentials_to_identity.py` copies each
bcrypt hash into the package's `credentials` table and
`migrate_totp_seeds_to_identity.py` seals each TOTP seed into `totp-factors`;
both leave the legacy columns exactly where they were. This script removes them,
and only for a user whose replacement is provably present.

Mirrors Portfolio's `backend/scripts/clear_legacy_credentials.py`, which cleared
one column. This one clears two, because CarModPicker carries a plaintext base32
TOTP seed on the user row as well as the password hash, and
`docs/security/totp-seed-encryption.md` records that plaintext as a known
finding. Clearing them in one pass means one read of the users table, one
refusal rule, and one entry in the runbook rather than two that can be run in
the wrong order.

`docs/identity-migration-runbook.md` is the runbook and gives the order of
operations for row 13.

## READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING IT

**No route in the application writes `hashed_password` any more, so this script
is safe to run once the two migration scripts have.**

Row 13 deleted the `/api/auth` routers, and the users domain follow up deleted
the three routes that were the last writers of the column:

  - `POST /api/users/` (public registration), deleted outright
  - the password change on `PUT /api/users/{user_id}`, deleted
  - the admin password set on `PUT /api/users/admin/users/{user_id}`, deleted

Registration is the package's `POST /api/auth/register` now and a password
change is its `POST /api/auth/password`; both write the `credentials` table the
identity function owns, so the users domain writes no password at all.
`UserRepository.get_legacy_password_hash` and `set_legacy_password_hash` are
gone with them, and nothing in the backend reads or writes the column.

The refusal rules below still stand as the practical check: a password that
exists only in the legacy column classifies as `mismatch`, and a `mismatch`
refuses the whole run.

## What it will not do

**It never clears a column it cannot account for.** Each user is classified
before anything is written, and the two columns are classified independently:

  - `cleared`             at least one legacy column was removed, and every
                          column removed had a confirmed replacement,
  - `already_clear`       neither legacy column is on the row,
  - `mismatch`            a replacement exists but holds a different secret
                          from the legacy column,
  - `missing_credential`  a legacy column is present and its replacement is
                          absent,
  - `errors`              the write itself failed.

`mismatch` and `missing_credential` are refusals rather than warnings, and the
process exits non-zero on either, because both mean removing the column would
take away a way into the account without having confirmed there is another one.

A `mismatch` on the password is usually a password changed after the migration
ran, through one of the three routes named above. The right answer is still a
human: re-run `migrate_credentials_to_identity.py --replace` so the identity
store carries the newer secret, then run this again. This script will not make
that judgement on its own.

An account with **neither** column and no credential is `already_clear` rather
than a refusal. That is an OAuth only or passkey only account, which is an
ordinary state and not a migration that failed.

## Removal, not an empty string

Both attributes are REMOVEd, through a DynamoDB `REMOVE` expression, so the
attribute stops existing rather than holding `""`.

That matters for more than tidiness. `verify_password` answers `False` for an
empty string, so an empty column and a missing one behave identically. But an
empty column reads as "deliberately blanked" rather than "never there", and a
row created through the package's registration flow has no such attribute at
all, so removal is what makes a migrated row and a natively created row
identical.

**Nothing in the backend requires either attribute to be present.** Checked
before writing this:

  - `app/db/dynamo/users.py`'s `User` model declares neither field as of row 13,
    and its `model_config` is `extra="ignore"`, so a row that still carries one
    loads with the attribute dropped rather than refused.
  - `app/api/schemas/user.py`'s `UserRead` never mentioned either, so no
    response model can fail on a missing column.
  - No repository method reads the attribute since the users domain follow up
    deleted `get_legacy_password_hash`, so a row without it cannot fail a read.
  - `totp_enabled` stays on the model and is untouched here. It is the flag the
    profile UI renders; the seed it refers to lives sealed in `totp-factors`.

## Dry run by default

Nothing is written unless `--apply` is passed, on the same rule both migration
scripts follow: the first run against an environment is always a read.

## No secret is ever printed

Not in the summary, not in a detail line, not in an error. Every comparison is
made in memory and reported as a verdict. A script that printed the secret it
was about to delete would put the thing it is retiring into a terminal
scrollback and a CI log.
