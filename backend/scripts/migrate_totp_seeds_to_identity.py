"""Seal each user's plaintext TOTP seed into the identity `totp-factors` table.

The other half of row 7. `migrate_credentials_to_identity.py` moves first
factors; this moves second ones, and it is the script that decides whether a
user with an authenticator app can still sign in after the cutover.

`docs/identity-migration-runbook.md` gives the order of operations.

## The seed is unchanged, so no authenticator is re-enrolled

CarModPicker stores `users.totp_secret` as an unpadded uppercase base32 string
and feeds it to `pyotp.TOTP`, which is RFC 6238 with the universal defaults:
HMAC-SHA1, 30 second steps, six digits. `webbpulse.identity.totp` is the same
arithmetic with the same defaults over the same base32 seed, and it accepts the
padding and case a stored seed might carry.

So the migration moves the **same bytes** into a new place, and every phone
already holding the account keeps producing codes that verify. Nobody rescans a
QR code. `tests/scripts/test_totp_seed_migration.py` proves that by sealing with
this script and then verifying a `pyotp`-generated code through the package's
own `MfaService`, which is the code path that runs after the cutover.

## What sealing means, and why it is not a copy

The plaintext seed is the one identity secret that cannot be hashed: the server
recomputes the code, so the value has to come back. `docs/security/totp-seed-encryption.md`
is the finding that CarModPicker stores it in the clear on the user row, and
this is the fix.

`EnvelopeCipher` generates a fresh AES-256 data key from KMS under
`IDENTITY_DATA_KEY_ARN`, encrypts the seed locally with AES-256-GCM, and stores
the ciphertext, the nonce and the KMS wrapped data key. Reading a usable seed
then needs `dynamodb:GetItem` **and** `kms:Decrypt`, and every decrypt is a
CloudTrail event.

The **encryption context** is `{"user_id": <id>, "purpose": "totp"}`, built by
the package's own `encryption_context` and never spelled here. KMS binds it into
the wrapped key as authenticated data, so a ciphertext copied into another
user's row fails to decrypt rather than silently authenticating the wrong
person. This script must produce exactly the context `MfaService._open_seed`
rebuilds on the verify path, which is why it calls `EnvelopeCipher.seal` with
the `user_id` rather than assembling an item itself.

## `activated_at` is derived from `totp_enabled`, and that is the whole state

`TotpFactorRecord.is_active` is `bool(activated_at)`, and only an **active**
factor appears in `MfaService.factors_for` and therefore in the login challenge.

- `totp_enabled = True` migrates with `activated_at` set, so the user is
  challenged for a code exactly as they are today.
- `totp_enabled = False` with a seed present is a **pending enrolment**: the user
  started setup and never confirmed it. It migrates with `activated_at` empty,
  so it does not gate login, matching what the legacy code does with such a row.

Getting this backwards in either direction is the failure mode worth guarding.
Activating a pending enrolment would challenge a user whose authenticator never
received the seed and lock them out; leaving an enabled factor inactive would
silently drop a working second factor to none.

`last_used_step` starts at 0. The legacy implementation keeps no replay
watermark, so there is nothing to carry, and 0 means "nothing accepted yet",
which accepts the user's next code and refuses every replay after it.

## No seed is ever logged, and this is enforced

`report` prints user ids, actions and reasons. It never prints a seed, a
ciphertext, a nonce or a wrapped key, and there is no verbose flag that would.
The `Decision` this script carries deliberately holds **no** seed field: the
plaintext is read inside `migrate`, sealed, and dropped, so a decision list that
escapes into a log or a traceback cannot carry one.
`tests/scripts/test_totp_seed_migration.py` asserts that on the real output.

## Clearing the plaintext is a separate, later pass

Three modes, and they are meant to be run as three separate commands:

1. `--apply` seals every seed into `totp-factors` and **leaves
   `users.totp_secret` exactly where it is**. Both copies exist, and the legacy
   2FA path keeps working, so this is reversible by deleting the new rows.
2. `--verify` opens every sealed row back through `EnvelopeCipher` and checks it
   equals the plaintext still on the user row. This is what makes step 3 safe,
   and it is why step 1 does not clear.
3. `--clear-plaintext` sets `users.totp_secret` to `None` on rows whose sealed
   copy verifies. It refuses any row it could not verify, so a seed is never
   destroyed while the only other copy is unreadable.

`docs/security/totp-seed-encryption.md` prefers a lazy migrate-on-use, and its
reversibility concern is exactly what the split above answers: until step 3
runs, rollback is doing nothing.

## SECRET_KEY and EMAIL_FROM are set to placeholders at import

As in the sibling credential script: `app.core.config` refuses to construct
without them, and this migration authenticates nobody.
