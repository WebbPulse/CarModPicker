"""Copy each user's bcrypt password hash into the identity `credentials` table.

Row 7 of the identity adoption plan, and the data half of the cutover. Row 5
puts the identity Lambda, its hooks and the package flows in place; row 4 puts
the six identity tables there. Neither moves a single existing password, so
until this script runs the `credentials` table is empty and every account signs
in through the legacy `/api/auth/token` route and through nothing else. Running
it is what makes flipping `VITE_AUTH_MODE` to `identity` a variable change
rather than a lockout.

`docs/identity-migration-runbook.md` gives the order of operations, and
`migrate_totp_seeds_to_identity.py` is the other half, for second factors.

## The hash copies verbatim, and here is why that is safe

The legacy attribute and the identity credential hold **the same bytes produced
by the same function**, so this is a copy and not a rehash. No account resets a
password.

- The legacy hash is written through `app/api/dependencies/auth.py`'s
  `get_password_hash`, a one line adapter over
  `webbpulse.security.hash_password`.
- The identity registration flow writes its credential in
  `webbpulse/identity/flows.py`, calling `hash_password` from that same
  `webbpulse.security`.
- Verification matches too: the legacy path reaches `verify_password` in the
  same adapter module, and the identity login flow calls the same function.

One bcrypt implementation, one cost of 12, one 72 byte truncation applied
identically on hash and on verify. `tests/test_long_password_regression.py` and
`tests/test_token_hash_compatibility.py` already pin that from the other side.

The script still **validates** rather than assuming. `is_supported_hash`
rejects anything that is not a bcrypt modular crypt string of the right length,
and a row carrying one is reported and skipped rather than written as a
credential that could never verify.

## OAuth only accounts are a `skip`, not a failure

CarModPicker signs users in with Google as well as with a password, and a
Google-only account has `hashed_password = None` on the user row. There is
nothing to copy and nothing wrong: the account keeps working through the OAuth
path, which needs no credential row.

They are counted separately from the other skips, under `skip_oauth_only`, and
the reason is the summary. On a production run these are a large fraction of
the rows, and a single `skip` total that mixed them with genuinely unreadable
hashes would look like data loss and would hide the handful of rows that really
do need a human.

## Idempotence, and what a rerun does

Safe to run repeatedly, which matters because the runbook runs it once per
environment and a half finished run has to be resumable.

A user whose credential is already present with the same secret is left exactly
as it is, `created_at` included, and counted as `unchanged`. One whose stored
secret differs is only rewritten under `--replace`; without it the row is
reported as a conflict and the script exits non-zero, because a credential that
disagrees with the legacy attribute is either a password changed through the
identity flow after the cutover began or a run pointed at the wrong
environment's tables, and both want a human rather than an overwrite.

`created_at` is preserved on an unchanged row rather than refreshed. The value
is the moment the credential came into existence, and a rerun of a migration is
not a new credential.

## Dry run by default

Nothing is written unless `--apply` is passed. The default prints the plan and
exits, so the runbook's first step against any environment is always a read.

## Table names come from the environment, not from a constant

`--prefix` defaults to `DYNAMODB_TABLE_PREFIX`, the variable every function
already carries and the one `app/db/dynamo/client.py` builds every table name
from. The logical names are the package's own `CREDENTIALS_TABLE` and this
repository's `USERS.suffix`, so a rename in either place travels here without an
edit.

## The store is the package's, not a hand rolled PutItem

Writes go through `webbpulse.identity.DynamoCredentialStore` over a
`webbpulse.dynamodb.Repository`, the same pair the running identity function
builds. That is deliberate: the item shape, the `created_at`/`updated_at`
defaulting and the key names are the package's problem, and a script writing its
own item dict would be a second implementation of a shape the package is free to
change. `PASSWORD_CREDENTIAL_TYPE` is imported from the package rather than
spelled `"password"` here, so this script and the flow that reads the row cannot
disagree about the range key.

## SECRET_KEY and EMAIL_FROM are set to placeholders at import

`app.core.config` builds a `Settings` at import and refuses to construct without
them. This migration reads users, writes credentials and authenticates nobody,
so the placeholders never reach a hash or a token. They are set with `setdefault`
so a real environment carrying them is left alone.
