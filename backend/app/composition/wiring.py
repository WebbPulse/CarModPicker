"""The nine domains, and how one application is built from any subset of them.

This module is the single description of what a domain is: its name, the routers
it owns, the prefix and tags those routers mount under, and which secrets a
process serving it cannot answer a request without. Root A
(`app.composition.app`) walks the whole map; Root B
(`app.entrypoints.<domain>`) picks one entry out of it. Neither holds a second
copy of the list, which is what stops the composed application and the deployed
function drifting apart.

## `load_routers` is a callable on purpose

Importing this module must import no endpoint module. `load_routers` defers that
import to the moment a root actually builds the application, so
`app.entrypoints.media` reaches `app.api.endpoints.images` and nothing else. The
other eight domains' endpoint modules, their services and their schemas are never
imported in that process, which is the whole point of the indirection and what
keeps a cold start proportional to one domain rather than to the application.
`tests/entrypoints/test_entrypoint_isolation.py` asserts it in a fresh
interpreter, because a single module-scope import added here would undo it
silently.

## Registration order is load-bearing

FastAPI resolves routes in registration order, and section 1.4 of the split plan
lists seven places where CarModPicker depends on it: `/api/parts/count` before
`/api/parts/{entity_id}`, `/api/part-price-alerts/unsubscribe` before
`/{alert_id}`, and five more. Every one of those pairs lives inside a single
endpoint module, so they survive as long as a module's own decorator order is
untouched, which this PR does not touch: the routers are the same objects
`app/main.py` has always registered.

The one thing this PR does change is the order of the modules relative to each
other. `app/main.py` registers them interleaved by kind rather than by domain
(users, car-generations, build-lists, parts, ...), and grouping them by domain
moves modules past each other. That is safe here, and it was verified rather
than assumed: no route in any domain matches a concrete path belonging to a
different domain, so no cross-domain pair can shadow. The OpenAPI document is
unaffected because it is serialised with sorted keys.

## The composition root is not `mount`

Root A composes with `include_router`, never with `mount`. Starlette strips a
mount path before the sub-application sees it, and a mounted sub-application
contributes nothing to the parent's OpenAPI document, so mounting would give an
application whose routes resolve but whose `/api/openapi.json` is empty. Both
roots therefore produce identical paths, which is what
`tests/entrypoints/test_route_split.py` compares.
