"""Split plan row 25: the `part_listings` stream consumer that mails price alerts.

Three layers of test here, and each exists because the layer below it cannot
prove the thing it proves.

The first drives `app.consumers.price_alerts` against fake repositories. What
that module actually does is decide, from two stream images, whether a price
fell and which listing to evaluate once; the properties worth pinning are all
about that decision and about which sequence numbers come back on a failure, not
about DynamoDB. Fakes make the call counts assertable, which is the only way to
show that five writes to one listing in a batch are one evaluation rather than
five, and that a re-stamp of an unchanged price is zero.

The second is the idempotency layer, and it is the one this row exists for. A
DynamoDB stream is at-least-once, so the same record can arrive twice and the
side effect here is an email that cannot be unsent. These tests replay records
and assert that no second message reaches SES.

The third puts a fake SES client under the real `app.core.email` send path, so
the whole chain runs: stream record, drop detection, threshold, cooldown, the
signed unsubscribe token, and the `sesv2.send_email` call itself. **No real mail
is ever sent.** `boto3.client` is replaced, so there is no network call and no
credentials involved; what is asserted is the request that would have gone out.
That matters because `send_price_drop_alert_email` reaches `create_access_token`
for the unsubscribe JWT, which is the hidden `SECRET_KEY` dependency that made
this consumer set `secrets = true` where row 24's did not. A test that stubbed
the send would never have touched it.
