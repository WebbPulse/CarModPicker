"""Split plan row 30: seam 1's user delete cascade, drained off the `users` stream.

The same three layers row 28's test file established, for the same reasons, over
a cascade about four times the size.

The first drives `app.consumers.user_delete` against fakes. The handler is a pure
function of a batch and a client or a bundle, and the properties that matter
(which records are tombstones, one message per user however many records, which
identifiers come back on a failure) are about grouping and reporting rather than
about AWS.

The second is the idempotency layer, and it carries more weight here than it did
on seam 2. Seam 2's cascade was four independent deletes. This one has five
groups across eighteen tables, one of which (`purge_owned_parts`) writes
tombstones that feed *another* consumer, and one of which
(`purge_owned_build_lists`) runs a transaction. A retry can therefore arrive with
any prefix of that already done, and the interesting case is not the clean replay
but the half-done one: a step that already ran running again with the rows it
created gone. That is tested directly, as is the bisected batch, where the
records that succeeded are re-delivered alongside the one that did not.

The third layer runs the cascade against moto through the real repositories. The
fakes below encode an assumption about what `delete_for_user`, `delete_all_for_user`
and `delete_build_list_cascade` do on a second call, and a fake that agrees with a
wrong assumption proves nothing. It also pins the one behaviour this row depends
on that seam 2 did not have to think about: `PartService.purge` raising
`ItemNotFound` for a part that is already gone, which is what makes a replay of
the parts step a success rather than a batch failure.

There is a fourth thing pinned here that is not really a layer: that the user row
and its two unique reservations are *not* in this cascade. Both are asserted, in
`TestTheSynchronousHalfStayedBehind`, because that is the decision row 30 made and
an absence is exactly the kind of thing a later change removes by accident.
