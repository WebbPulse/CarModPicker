"""Row 9: the package's M5 passkeys and M6 OAuth, and the switches that gate them.

Row 5 mounted M1 to M4 and `tests/test_identity_row5.py` pins what an identity
function serves with none of this row's switches on: twenty-one routes,
including the two unconditional discovery routes,
`GET /api/auth/oauth/providers` from 0.16.0 and
`GET /api/auth/passkeys/availability` from 0.17.0. This file owns the twelve
that the switches control, and the switches themselves.

## What is actually being tested, which is a configuration contract

Almost nothing here is a test of the package. The package's own suite covers
whether a passkey verifies and whether a token exchange works, and repeating
that here would be asserting that somebody else's code does what their tests
already say it does.

What this file tests is the seam: that the six environment variables
`terraform/lambda_domains.tf` renders are the six the package reads, that each
one turns on exactly what it claims to, and that the two client secrets travel
from the `carmodpicker-<env>/app` secret into the argument the package takes
rather than into a settings field. Every one of those is a thing that can be
broken by a Terraform edit with no Python change at all, which is precisely the
class of failure a backend test suite normally cannot see.

So the environment is written as environment variables rather than passed as
arguments, exactly as row 5's file does and for the same reason:
`IdentitySettings` is a `BaseSettings` with `env_prefix="IDENTITY_"` and
`app/composition/identity.py` constructs it with no arguments at all. A test
that built the settings object directly would not notice a Terraform variable
renamed, or never set.

## Why the fixtures are imported from row 5's file rather than rewritten

`identity_env`, `identity_app`, `private_key` and `FakeKms` are the deployed
identity function's environment and a local RSA signer, and there is one correct
version of each. Copying them would mean two inventories of `IDENTITY_*` names
drifting apart, and the drift would show up as this file passing while the
deployed function is misconfigured. The fixtures below layer on top by setting
more variables before `identity_app` builds, which works because `identity_env`
is an ordinary fixture dependency and `monkeypatch.setenv` from a fixture that
depends on it runs after it.

## The two flags default ON in the package and OFF here

`IdentitySettings.passkeys_enabled` and `passkeys_passwordless` both default to
`True`, because the standard's baseline is mandatory and the flags exist to
stage a rollout rather than to opt out. `terraform/variables.tf` defaults both to
`false` and the staging workspace sets both `true`, which is a deliberate
departure and the one thing in this row that is a judgement rather than a
mechanical adoption: a default that turns a sign-in method on in whichever
environment applies next fails in the wrong direction. Production receives the
same variables at promotion.

`terraform/lambda_domains.tf` renders both on every identity function in every
environment, so an unset flag is not a state a deployed function is ever in, and
`test_the_passkey_routes_are_absent_with_the_flag_off` is what says the off
state is really off rather than the package's default leaking through.

## What is deliberately not here

**No test of the legacy WebAuthn or legacy Google routes.** They are untouched by
this row, they still serve, and `tests/entrypoints/test_route_split.py` already
pins them. Row 13 retires them.

**No migration of their contents.** `docs/identity-migration-runbook.md` records
what a future migration of `oauth_accounts` and `webauthn_credentials` would map;
this row writes no such script and no test asserts one exists.
