"""Regression: a password over bcrypt's 72 byte limit must not fault.

bcrypt reads at most 72 bytes of a password and ignores the rest. What differs
between library versions is what happens when it is handed more: bcrypt 4.x
truncates silently, and bcrypt 5.0.0, which this app pins, raises

    ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes

The schemas cap a password at `PASSWORD_MAX_LENGTH` characters, and the comment
there says the cap exists because of that bcrypt limit. But a character is not a
byte. The cap is enforced by pydantic's `max_length`, which counts characters, so
72 accented, CJK or emoji characters are 144 bytes or more, pass validation
cleanly, and then reached `bcrypt.hashpw` and became a 500. Signup, password
reset and password change were all affected, and login against such an account
was unreachable because the account could never be created in the first place.

`webbpulse.security` truncates to 72 **bytes** before bcrypt sees the value, on a
byte boundary rather than a character boundary, so these now hash and verify like
any other password. Byte truncation is what keeps the hash identical to what any
other implementation writes for the same input; trimming back to the last whole
character would feed bcrypt different bytes.

These tests use a multi-byte password rather than a long ASCII one on purpose.
An ASCII password of 73 characters is rejected by the schema with a 422, which is
correct behaviour and not the bug. The multi-byte case is the one that got past
validation, and it is the case that regressed.

Row 13 of `docs/identity-adoption.md` deleted the four routers under `/api/auth`,
and with them the login and password reset halves of this regression. What is
left is the half that still has live callers: the hashing primitives, and
`POST /api/users/` which is the users domain's own route and still takes a
password. Login against an over limit account is now the package's business and
is covered by the package's own tests.
