"""Adopting `webbpulse.security` must not log anybody out or invalidate a stored hash.

This deploys to a running service holding live sessions and a table of bcrypt
hashes written by the code being replaced. Neither can be migrated: there is no
way to re-hash a password nobody has typed yet, and no way to re-mint a token
sitting in somebody's browser. So the swap is only safe if the new code reads
what the old code wrote, and these tests pin both halves of that.

The old primitives are reproduced here literally, as `_legacy_*`, rather than
imported. Importing them would defeat the point once they are deleted; written
out, they keep asserting against what production actually wrote even though that
code no longer exists in the tree.

The two facts that make this work:

  - **Hashes.** The local `get_password_hash` passed `rounds=12` explicitly and
    the package's `DEFAULT_ROUNDS` is also 12, so the stored value has the same
    algorithm, cost and format. bcrypt hashes carry their own salt and cost, so
    verification is a property of the string, not of who wrote it.
  - **Tokens.** Both sign HS256 with `settings.SECRET_KEY` over the same claims.
    The package additionally stamps `iat`, which is additive: nothing here
    requires it to be absent, and a token minted without it still decodes.
