"""Row 10: the Chrome extension's sign in handoff, and what it refuses.

Row 10 of `docs/identity-adoption.md`. `app/composition/identity_extension.py`
declares two routes, and unlike rows 5 and 9 this is product code rather than a
package mount, so this file tests behaviour and not only a configuration seam.

## What is worth testing here

The handoff is a credential-issuing path with three checks holding it up, and
each one is the only thing standing between a caller and somebody else's
session:

1. **Who is asking.** `POST /extension/handoff` needs a verified access token.
   Without that, knowing a redirect URI would be enough to mint a code for an
   arbitrary `sub`.
2. **Which extension.** The redirect target must name an id on
   `CHROME_EXTENSION_IDS`, the same variable the CORS allow list reads. Without
   that, a page could send a code to an extension the user never installed.
3. **What a code is.** `POST /extension/token` must accept a handoff code and
   refuse an access token. Without the `typ` and `aud` checks, an access token
   could be exchanged for a fresh access token with a reset expiry, which turns
   a ten minute credential into an unbounded one.

Each has a test that fails if the check is deleted, which is the property that
makes them worth having rather than restatements of the code.

## Why the tokens are minted through the router's own signer

The tests sign with `FakeKms` from row 5's file, which is a real RSA key with
KMS's interface. So a code this file builds by hand verifies exactly as one the
route minted, and one with a wrong `aud` or `typ` fails for the reason the route
says rather than because the signature is fake. A stubbed verifier would let
every one of the three checks above be deleted without a failure here.

## What is deliberately not tested

**Not the package's token machinery.** Whether an RS256 signature verifies and
whether `aud` is enforced are `webbpulse.identity`'s own tests. What this file
tests is that this product passes the right audience and asserts the right
`typ`.

**Not the frontend page.** `frontend/src/pages/authentication/ExtensionHandoff.
test.tsx` owns the redirect target validation on that side. The duplication of
the check is the point, so both sides have their own test.

**Not the extension.** `chrome-extension/` has no test runner: its CI is
type-check, `npm audit` and build. The manual steps are in the pull request.
