"""Row 11: the domains read the authorizer's claims, and `sub` is the user id.

Row 11 of `docs/identity-adoption.md`. Rows 8 and 9 put the identity access
token in front of fifteen `/api/auth` route keys at the gateway; this row is
where `app/api/dependencies/auth.py` turns a verified token into a `DBUser`,
alongside the legacy HS256 session rather than instead of it.

## What is worth testing here

Three properties, and each one fails loudly if the code it covers is deleted.

1. **The legacy session is untouched.** Row 12 is the cutover and row 13 is what
   retires the legacy flow, so until then a dual-mode change that quietly
   regressed the shipped path would be the worst outcome this row could have.
   Every legacy assertion here is a restatement of behaviour that was already
   true, on purpose: they are the ones that fail if the new branch swallowed the
   old one.
2. **Both authorizer shapes resolve, and to the same user.** Production's native
   JWT authorizer puts claims at `authorizer.jwt.claims`; the staging access gate
   publishes one JSON string at `authorizer.lambda["jwt.claims"]`. The whole
   point of row 11's reader is that a caller sees one answer either way, so the
   two shapes are driven through the same request and compared.
3. **`sub` is the user id and not the username.** This is the mapping the row
   turns on and it is the one thing that would be silently wrong if it were
   guessed: the legacy session's `sub` is a **username**, the identity token's
   `sub` is a **uuid7 user id**, and a reader that tried the wrong lookup would
   still find a user on a system where someone's username happens to parse.

## What is deliberately not tested

**Not the signature.** Whether an RS256 token verifies is `webbpulse.identity`'s
own test, and on a flagged route key the gateway has already checked it before
this application runs. What is tested here is that a claim set reaches the
resolver and that a user id comes out.

**Not the gateway.** Which route keys are flagged is `terraform/apigateway.tf`
and the staging access gate module's own tests. This file starts from the event
those produce.

**Not in-process verification on a domain function.** `verify_bearer_subject`
answers `""` without `IDENTITY_SIGNING_KEY_ARNS` and a `kms:GetPublicKey` grant,
which no domain but `identity` has. That is asserted as the deployment fact it
is, rather than mocked into passing, because mocking it would test a
configuration this estate does not have.
