"""What the two delete cascades remove.

Row 23 of `docs/migration/split-plan.md` wrote these tests against the two
synchronous cascades, deliberately, so that rows 28 and 30 would have a
reference to diff against rather than a description. Row 28 has now cut seam 2,
and this is that diff.

Both seams are now asynchronous, and the change to these tests is smaller than
that makes it sound. `PartService.purge` writes a tombstone and removes everything
`catalog` owns; the four cross domain deletes moved to
`app/consumers/part_purge.py`, off the `parts` stream and through the
`part-purge` work queue. The end state is identical, so the assertions about
what does not survive are identical too. What changed is only that the cascade
is driven by draining the queue rather than by a function call, which is what
`_drain_part_purge` below stands in for.

Seam 1, row 30. `_delete_user_everywhere` in `app/api/endpoints/users.py` now
writes a tombstone, hard deletes the user row and its two unique reservations,
and returns. Everything else it used to do moved to
`app/consumers/user_delete.py`, off the `users` stream and through the
`user-delete` work queue, which is what `_drain_user_delete` below stands in
for. The end state is again identical, so the assertions about what does not
survive are again identical.

The one assertion that deliberately runs *before* any drain is the reservation
one: a user who deletes an account can register the same username and email
immediately, on the next request, without the consumer having run. That is the
decision row 30 made and it is asserted here rather than described, because it
is the half of the cascade that did not move.

The test that did not change at all is the one that matters most:
`test_deleting_a_part_through_the_api_removes_it_from_build_lists` still passes
unmodified. A tombstoned part reads as absent everywhere the moment the delete
returns, because row 23 put `is_tombstoned` on every join that reaches a part,
so a build list drops the row without waiting for the consumer. That is the
property that makes the asynchrony invisible to a caller, and leaving that test
untouched is the proof of it.
