"""RBAC sweep: every protected route under /api/ (excluding /api/admin and /api/auth,
which have their own coverage suites) requires authentication.

Companion to:
  - tests/test_admin_auth_coverage.py — covers /api/admin/* (anon 401, regular-user 403)
  - tests/test_auth_auth_coverage.py — covers /api/auth/* (anon 401, public allow-list)

This file closes the gap on the rest of the API surface (~115 routes spanning
build_lists, parts, votes, reports, images, etc.). It catches accidental
removal of auth dependencies on owner-scoped routes — the most likely place
RBAC drift can sneak in.

Public routes are explicitly allow-listed below. Adding a new public route
is a deliberate, review-gated change. Drift in either direction trips CI:
  - A protected route losing its auth dep → fails the 401 sweep
  - A public route gaining an auth dep → fails the public sanity check
  - A new route added without a test update → fails the count drift guard

NOTE: This sweep covers anonymous → 401 only. Non-owner → 403 (the harder
boundary, since each domain has its own owner concept and fixture wiring) is
not covered here; per-domain tests carry that load (e.g. test_authorization.py,
test_build_list_labor_estimates.py).
