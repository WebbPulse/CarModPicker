"""`requirements-lambda.txt` must be a strict subset of `requirements.txt`.

Two files declare this application's dependencies and they are installed by
different things. `requirements.txt` is what CI installs and what the test suite
runs against; `requirements-lambda.txt` is what the deploy zip resolves for
manylinux x86_64 and what the per-domain container image installs. It is the
narrower of the two on purpose, carrying only the runtime packages: pytest,
black, moto and locust have no business in a Lambda image.

The failure mode this guards is quiet and expensive. A runtime dependency added
to `requirements.txt` alone passes every check, because every check installs
that file, and then fails at import inside the image, which is the first place
the package is actually missing. A pin that drifts between the two is worse
still: the suite then proves a version the image does not run, so a green build
says nothing about what deploys. Adopting `webbpulse` is exactly that kind of
change, which is why this test arrived with it.

"Strict subset" means both directions of one relationship. Every requirement in
the Lambda file must appear in `requirements.txt`, and the two specifiers must be
character-identical including extras, so `webbpulse[fastapi,otel]==0.2.0` in one
and `webbpulse==0.2.0` in the other is a failure rather than a near miss. The
reverse containment is deliberately not asserted: `requirements.txt` is expected
to hold more, and enumerating which extras are development-only here would
duplicate a judgement the two files already express.
