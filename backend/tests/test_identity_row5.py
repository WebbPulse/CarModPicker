"""Row 5: the identity hooks, and the package router mounted on the identity app.

This row adds two files and one mount. `app/composition/identity_hooks.py` is
the product policy half of the seam and `app/composition/identity.py` is the
composition half, and `build_domain_app` includes the second one on the identity
domain application only, guarded on `IDENTITY_ISSUER` being set.

What this file does not test is the package's own behaviour. That a TOTP code
verifies inside its window, that a refresh token rotates, that a reset link is
single use: the package's suite covers all of it, and asserting it again here
would pin the same behaviour twice and say nothing about CarModPicker.

What it tests is the four things only this repository can be wrong about.

**The hooks answer this product's questions.** `may_authenticate` has to refuse
a disabled account, a service account and an unverified address, because those
three flags are CarModPicker's own and the package has never heard of them.
`claims_for` has to put this product's two roles and its username into the
token, because every other domain reads them from there. The protocol is
asserted structurally with `isinstance`, which is what turns a package release
that grows a hook into a failure here rather than an `AttributeError` mid-login
in staging.

**The mount is conditional and the condition is the issuer.** With
`IDENTITY_ISSUER` unset the identity application is byte for byte the one row 4
left behind, which is what keeps `tests/fixtures/route_contract.json`, the
per-domain counts in `tests/entrypoints/test_route_split.py` and the OpenAPI
snapshot valid without regenerating any of them. Set it, and twenty-one routes
appear. Both halves are asserted, because a mount that fired unconditionally
would break three pinned fixtures and a mount that never fired would look
exactly like success from the outside.

**The public paths are `/api/auth/...` with no prefix of this repository's
own.** `build_identity_router` places every route under `identity_prefix`, which
is the path component of the issuer, so the caller mounts with no prefix and the
issuer is the single thing that decides where the routes land. Passing a prefix
here would double it to `/api/api/auth`. The test asserts the paths rather than
the absence of an argument, because the path is what API Gateway routes on.

**The legacy routes still win the two collisions.** `POST /api/auth/logout` and
`POST /api/auth/verify-email` exist on both sides. The package router is
included after the legacy routers and FastAPI keeps the first match, so the
legacy handler answers both, which is what makes this row additive rather than a
cutover. The assertion is on the winning endpoint's module, so a reordering of
the include is a failure here rather than a silent change of behaviour on two
paths the frontend uses today.
