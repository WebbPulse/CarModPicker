"""Which repositories a domain's process carries, and which it cannot reach.

Section 2.3 of `docs/migration/split-plan.md` names the `Repositories` singleton
as the blocker: twenty-five repositories constructed at module import, reached by
every route, so every one of the nine functions would have imported the whole
data layer at cold start and held a live `UserRepository` pointed at a table it
has no IAM grant for. This module is what stops that coming back.

Four claims, in order of what they protect.

**A domain declares the repositories its own code reaches, and no others.** The
tuples in `app/composition/domains.py` are recomputed here from the real import
graph, so a tuple that grew a repository nothing uses fails, and so does one
missing a repository a route reaches. The first is an IAM grant the function
does not need; the second is a `RepositoryNotInBundle` in production on whichever
route reaches it first. Neither is visible by reading the tuple.

**A bundle refuses what it does not carry.** Attribute access outside the
declared set raises rather than returning something, and the message names the
table, because the next question is always which grant is missing.

**Building a domain's application constructs no repository, and importing it
imports no other domain's data modules.** Asserted in a fresh interpreter, the
same way `test_entrypoint_isolation.py` asserts the endpoint modules, because a
single eager construction in the wiring would undo it while every test still
passed.

**Root A still carries all twenty-five.** The monolith serves every route and
must keep every repository, so the union of the nine bundles is the whole set and
the application `app.main` exposes resolves to it.

## Why the plan's ownership column is not the assertion

Section 1.2 gives each table one owner, and a bundle is deliberately wider than
that. The difference is section 1.3's cross-domain reads, which the plan leaves
synchronous: `media` owns `image_source_mappings` and reads four more tables for
the orphan sweep, `vehicles` owns the three car tables and reads thirteen more
for search. Asserting the bundle equals the ownership column would fail on
exactly the reads the plan says to keep, so the ownership column is asserted
where it belongs instead: every table has an owner, every owner carries it, and
the reads on top are listed here by name so that a new one is a decision rather
than a drift.
