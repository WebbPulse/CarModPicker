"""The route contract, and the agreement between the two composition roots.

Three claims, in order of what they protect.

**Root A serves exactly the routes it served before the split.**
`tests/fixtures/route_contract.json` was captured from `app.main:app` on
`staging` before any of this existed, and is asserted here as a sorted list of
`(method, path)` pairs plus a count. It overlaps
`tests/test_openapi_snapshot.py`, deliberately: the snapshot pins the whole
published document and fails on a schema change as well as a routing one, while
this pins routing alone, so a failure here says "a route moved" rather than
"something in the document changed".

**Root B's routes are Root A's routes, partitioned.** The union of the nine
per-domain applications equals Root A exactly. This is the contract that lets a
cut be verified: when API Gateway starts sending `/api/images` to the `media`
function, the response has to be the one the monolith would have given, and it
can only be if `media`'s application declares the same routes.

**Each domain serves the number of routes the plan says it does.** Section 1.1
lists per-domain counts, and they are asserted individually rather than only in
aggregate, so a route moving between two domains fails loudly instead of
cancelling out in the total.

## 176 against 171

Section 2.7 of the plan speaks of 176 routes and section 1.1's per-domain table
sums to 171. Both are right and the difference is the five root routes.

- 171 are the domain routes under `/api`, and each of the nine per-domain counts
  in section 1.1 is exact.
- 5 more are `/`, `/health`, `/ready`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/sitemap-{name}.xml`,
  which belong to no domain and which every function serves locally, because the
  Lambda Web Adapter polls `/health` on every cold start and a function that did
  not answer it would never be marked ready.
- 176 is the sum, and it is what a deployed function's route table has to
  contain: its own domain's routes plus those five.

FastAPI adds four more of its own on top, which every count in the plan
excludes: `/docs`, `/docs/oauth2-redirect`, `/redoc` and `/api/openapi.json`.
So Root A serves 180 routes in total, and the constants below name all three
numbers so a future reader does not have to re-derive which is which.

## Counting routes is version dependent

`len(app.routes)` is not that 180 on every supported version, which is why
`_effective_routes` exists. Starlette 1.x, which `requirements.txt` pins via
FastAPI 0.141.1, changed `include_router` to store one lazy `_IncludedRouter`
per included router instead of copying the sub-router's routes into the parent.
On that version `app.routes` has 34 entries for Root A: the 4 doc routes, the 5
root routes, and 25 opaque wrappers whose own `path` and `methods` are `None`.
Walking it naively finds 9 routes and misses all 171. Starlette 0.x flattens on
include and the same walk finds all 180.

The difference is invisible in the served application: routing and the OpenAPI
document are identical either way, which is exactly why it is worth a test.
A count taken from `app.routes` silently means something different depending on
which version is installed, so every count here goes through
`_effective_routes`, which handles both shapes.
