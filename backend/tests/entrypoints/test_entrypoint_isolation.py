"""What each entrypoint may import, and what it may need to start.

Two properties, and both are about the deployed image rather than about the
response a route returns.

**A domain image carries one domain.** A single module-scope import in the
composition wiring would pull all nine domains into every image: every route
would still answer, the whole suite would still pass, and the only symptom would
be that the `media` function pays `catalog`'s import on every cold start and
ships code it has no IAM to use. Reading the source cannot see that; only
reading `sys.modules` after the fact can, so these tests run each entrypoint in a
fresh interpreter and inspect what actually got imported.

**A domain image starts with nothing.** The functions run with no AWS
credentials during a cold start's import phase, and `vehicles` is meant to run
with no `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` grant at all. If building the application
reads a secret, the function does not start, and it does not start in a way that
produces no application logs, because it fails before logging is configured.

So the subprocesses run under a stripped environment: no `AWS_*`, no
credentials, no region, nothing but what the settings class defaults. They also
run with `APP_SECRETS_ARN` pointing at an ARN that cannot be read, which is the
sharper version of the same test: a build that tried to resolve a secret would
not merely find nothing, it would attempt a network call and fail.
