"""Row 16: OpenTelemetry on in the domain functions, Sentry out of them.

Three properties, and each one fails quietly rather than loudly, which is why
each is asserted here rather than left to a smoke test against a deployed
function.

**Sentry is gone from the entrypoints.** Not from `app.main`: the monolith still
serves production until row 31 and keeps reporting through Sentry, so this is a
per-file assertion rather than a repository-wide one. A domain function that
still called `init_sentry` would work, and the only symptom would be two
reporting paths for the same request and a Sentry project that keeps looking
alive after the traffic behind it has moved.

**Tracing is configured before the application is built.** This is the one that
would have shipped broken. Every entrypoint carries a module-level
`app = build_app()` for Mangum, and that line runs at import, which is before
`main` has called `configure_tracing`. `build_domain_app` only attaches the
FastAPI instrumentation when a provider already exists, so instrumenting the
module-level application is impossible by construction, and `main` has to build
its own after configuring tracing. `instrument_app` can only inject its server
span middleware while the middleware stack is unbuilt, so getting this order
wrong produces a function that looks instrumented, logs nothing, and exports no
request spans at all.

**The gate still holds when the endpoint is unset.** Terraform sets
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` on the deployed functions and nothing sets
it in a test or a local run, so the gate is what keeps this suite from opening a
batch exporter against the real X-Ray endpoint.
