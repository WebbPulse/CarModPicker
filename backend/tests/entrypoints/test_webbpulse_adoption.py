"""What row 8 took from the shared package, and what it deliberately did not.

Adopting `webbpulse` moved logging, tracing, the settings base and the uvicorn
entry into the package. Three things it did **not** move are load-bearing for
CarModPicker's public contract, and each has a way of regressing quietly:

- **The error envelope.** CarModPicker now renders the shared
  `{"success", "status", "message", "request_id"}` envelope from
  `webbpulse.http.register_error_handlers`, with `error_code` on every error and
  `details` on a 422. It used to serve three shapes: a raw Starlette
  `{"detail": "Not Found"}` for an unmatched route, its own
  `{success, message, error_code}` for a handled one, and that plus `details`
  for a 422. These tests pin the single shape so a regression to any of the
  three is caught.
- **The tracing gate.** `webbpulse.otel.configure_tracing` defaults to this
  region's X-Ray OTLP endpoint when none is configured. Row 16 turned tracing on
  in the deployed domain functions by setting
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` in Terraform, but the gate itself stays,
  and it is what keeps the test suite and a local run free of an exporter. "Off
  when the variable is unset" therefore has to be asserted rather than assumed:
  without it every test run would open a batch exporter to an endpoint that
  answers 403 to an unsigned request and retries it in silence.
- **The request context filter.** `request_id` and `user_id` come from
  CarModPicker's ContextVars, not from the package, which merges trace ids
  instead. OBS-04 depends on every record carrying both.

`tests/test_log_propagation.py` covers the filter's behaviour during a request;
this file covers the wiring that has to survive the package adoption.
