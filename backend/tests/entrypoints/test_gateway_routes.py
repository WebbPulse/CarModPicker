"""Row 12: the domain route keys that require an authenticated caller.

`terraform/apigateway.tf` names 80 route keys in
`local.domain_identity_jwt_route_paths`, one per `/api` route outside
`/api/auth` whose FastAPI dependency tree reaches a resolver that refuses an
anonymous caller. That list is a second spelling of something the application
already knows, and the two can drift in the direction that matters: a route
added to a router with `get_current_user` on it and not added to the Terraform
is a route the gateway never checks, and nothing about it looks wrong from
either side on its own.

So this file recomputes the set from the application and asserts it is exactly
the set the Terraform names. **The set is derived, never listed here.** There is
no constant in this file enumerating the 80 keys, because a constant is a third
copy that drifts from both. Portfolio's `test_gateway_routes.py` is the
cautionary case: it subtracted one hand written constant per identity milestone,
so a milestone nobody remembered to add was asserted in neither direction, and
two of them shipped to staging with no route keys at all and answered the
gateway's own 404. The assertion that does not have that shape is the one that
builds the real application and compares against it, which is what every test
below does.

## What counts as requiring a caller

Three resolvers in `app/api/dependencies/auth.py`, and the distinction is the
whole subject of this row:

- `get_current_user`, `get_current_admin_user` and `get_current_superuser` raise
  401 when they cannot resolve a caller. A route behind one of them is already
  closed inside the function, and a flagged route key states the same thing one
  hop earlier at the gateway.
- `get_optional_current_user` and `get_current_active_user_optional` return
  `None` instead. A route behind one of those serves anonymous callers, usually
  personalising its answer when a caller is signed in, so flagging its key would
  turn a public page into a 401 for every signed out visitor. These are the trap
  in this row: the two resolvers are one word apart in a router and a route key
  cannot tell them apart.
- `require_api_key_or_admin` accepts a shared `X-API-Key` with no bearer token
  at all. Its one route is the Chrome extension's price history ingest, and
  flagging it would lock out the only callers it has.

## Why the Terraform is parsed rather than planned

The same reason `test_route_split.py` reads it: the keys are static text, and a
regex over them compares two sets of strings with no credentials, no workspace
and no network. A plan would assert the same thing and could not run in CI.
