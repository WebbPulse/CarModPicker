"""Identity-only smoke test: prove an environment runs on identity RS256 alone.

Row 13 deletes the 24 legacy `/api/auth` operations and the HS256 dual mode from
every resolver. Before that merges, the question worth real evidence is not
whether the tests pass, it is whether a live environment still needs any of it.
This script answers that against a deployed environment, over HTTP, with one
account it creates itself.

It checks four things, in the order they build on each other:

1. **An identity account can be created and can sign in.** Registration through
   the package's own `/api/auth/register`, then `/api/auth/login`, then the
   access token is decoded far enough to assert `alg` is RS256 and the issuer
   and audience are this environment's. A legacy HS256 token would fail that
   assertion rather than silently pass as "a token".
2. **Every domain function accepts that token.** One authenticated read and one
   authenticated write per domain Lambda. The write matters more than the read:
   a resolver that still decodes HS256 first and falls back can answer a read
   from cache or from an anonymous path, but a write goes through the ownership
   check that needs a real `sub`.
3. **The frontend bundle no longer names the legacy routes.** The deployed JS is
   fetched and grepped, because the bundle is what users actually run and a
   source tree that no longer mentions a route proves nothing about what is
   deployed in front of them.
4. **The 24 legacy operations are harmless.** Each is called with and without the
   token. What matters is that none answers 5xx and none answers 200: a 404 is
   the post-row-13 answer, a 401 or 403 is the pre-row-13 answer from a route
   that exists but refuses, and either is safe. A 200 means something still
   serves a legacy operation and row 13 would break it.

Staging's 58 synthetic users carry no credentials, so nothing there is
loginable. Rather than seeding a password onto one of them, which would put a
credential on a row that the migration is trying to empty, this registers a
fresh account through the public endpoint and leaves the credential where the
identity package puts it.

**`--verify-email` flips `email_verified` on the new row.** CarModPicker's
`may_authenticate` hook refuses an unverified address, and `@staging.invalid`
receives no mail, so without this the account can never sign in. The flip is the
same single field write `mark_email_verified` performs when a real user clicks
the link. It needs DynamoDB credentials, and it is a flag rather than the
default so that running this against production does not quietly confirm an
address nobody verified.

A non-zero exit is not automatically a reason to hold row 13. Read the matrix:
a domain write failing on a 404 because a fixture is missing is a defect in this
script, while a domain write failing on a 401 while carrying a valid identity
token is exactly the finding row 13 must not ship over. The summary separates
the two.

Staging answers only a request carrying the origin-verify header. Supply it in
`CARMODPICKER_ORIGIN_VERIFY`, the same variable `verify_route_cut.sh` and the
`smoke-domains` CI job read, sourced from SSM:

    export CARMODPICKER_ORIGIN_VERIFY=$(aws ssm get-parameter --with-decryption \
      --name /carmodpicker-staging/access-gate/origin-verify \
      --query Parameter.Value --output text)

Nothing is embedded here and no value is printed: the header, the password and
the token are redacted everywhere they could reach output.

Usage:

    scripts/identity_smoke.py --env staging --verify-email
    scripts/identity_smoke.py --env staging --keep-account   # skip cleanup
