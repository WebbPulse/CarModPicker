variable "identity_jwt_mode" {
  description = <<-EOT
    How the gateway enforces the identity module's access tokens on the routes that need an
    authenticated caller. The routes themselves are marked once, with require_identity_jwt in
    terraform/apigateway.tf; this variable only picks which of the two mechanisms carries out the
    check, because an HTTP API route takes exactly one authorizer and which one is free depends on
    whether the staging access gate is in front of the API.

      "gate"    The staging access gate's own Lambda authorizer does both checks: the signed gate
                cookie as before, then a valid Bearer access token on the marked routes. This is
                what a gated staging environment has to use, because the gate already occupies the
                route's one authorizer slot. module.api.identity_jwt stays null and no route moves.

      "native"  API Gateway's own JWT authorizer verifies the token: the RS256 signature against
                the issuer's JWKS, then iss, aud, exp and nbf, with nothing of ours on the request
                path. This is the ungated shape, which is what production is. The marked routes
                become authorization_type JWT and are replaced, because the platform module keeps
                them in a separate resource so the .well-known routes can exist before the
                authorizer and the protected routes after it.

      "off"     Nothing is enforced at the gateway. The identity function still verifies the token
                itself, which it does in every mode: this is an extra gate in front of it, never a
                replacement for its own check. Every route named in apigateway.tf keeps answering
                exactly as it does today.

    The default is "off" and PRODUCTION KEEPS IT for now. "native" creates an authorizer whose
    CreateAuthorizer call synchronously fetches <issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration from
    outside AWS, so it fails unless the identity function is already deployed and already serving
    those two documents at the production API host. The identity stack has not been promoted to
    production yet, so turning this on there before that promotion fails the apply rather than
    leaving anything open. Set it to "native" on the production workspace in the apply that follows
    the promotion, not before.

variable "domain_jwt_enforced" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether the 80 domain route keys that need an authenticated caller actually require an
    identity access token at the gateway. Row 12 of docs/identity-adoption.md.

    THE KEYS EXIST EITHER WAY. local.domain_identity_jwt_route_keys writes all 80 route keys into
    the API in both settings, pointing at the same integration the generated `ANY` pair points at,
    so a request reaches the same function by the same route regardless. This variable only decides
    whether each of those keys additionally carries require_identity_jwt, which is what puts it in
    module.api.identity_jwt_route_keys and so into the gate Lambda's list.

    THE DEFAULT IS false AND IT HAS TO BE, because of the ordering this row sits in. With
    identity_jwt_mode = "gate", the moment a key is marked the gate demands a valid RS256 identity
    access token on it, and the CarModPicker frontend still sends the legacy HS256 session token,
    which the gate rejects. Marking the keys before the frontend cutover signs every user out of
    every write path in staging. So the keys land first, unmarked and inert, and enforcement is a
    later one line flip on the workspace variable once the frontend sends identity tokens.

    WHAT THE FLIP COSTS IN A PLAN. In staging the platform module keeps a marked route in the same
    resource at the same address as an unmarked one, with the same authorization_type CUSTOM and
    the same gate authorizer, because it only moves routes into its own JWT resource when
    module.api.identity_jwt is non-null, and in gate mode that is null. So flipping this changes no
    route resource at all: the only diff is the gate authorizer Lambda's environment, which gains
    the 80 keys. Flipping it back is the rollback and is equally cheap.
