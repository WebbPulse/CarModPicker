# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CarModPicker is a full-stack web application for managing car modifications. Users can track their cars, create build lists with parts, browse a global parts catalog, and log their builds in forum-style threads. A companion Chrome extension scrapes parts from retailer pages.

**Stack:** FastAPI (Python 3.13) backend + React 19 (TypeScript) frontend, deployed on AWS as Lambda + HTTP API + DynamoDB. Infrastructure managed with Terraform (`terraform/`).

---

## Commands

### Backend (`backend/`)

```bash
# Start dev server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Local services (requires Docker): DynamoDB Local on :8001, MinIO on :9000
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down
python scripts/create_dynamo_tables.py   # create the app's tables in DynamoDB Local (idempotent)
python scripts/backfill_from_postgres.py --dry-run   # one-off Postgres -> DynamoDB copy (needs psycopg2-binary + DATABASE_URL)

# Table definitions live in app/db/dynamo/tables.py; regenerate the Terraform copy after editing
python scripts/export_dynamo_tables.py

# Tests — always run with -n auto for parallel execution
# Tests run against moto's in-memory DynamoDB — no services required
pytest -n auto
pytest -n auto --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
pytest -n auto path/to/test_file.py       # single file
pytest -n auto -k "test_name"             # single test
# Rate limiting is disabled in tests by default; set ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true to test it

# Linting / formatting
black --config pyproject.toml .
isort .
pyright
bandit -r app
```

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

```bash
npm run dev           # dev server on port 4000 (proxies /api to backend)
npm run dev:staging   # use staging API
npm run dev:prod      # use production API
npm run build         # tsc -b && vite build
npm run lint          # eslint
npm run type-check    # tsc --noEmit
npm test              # vitest
npm run test:coverage
```

### Chrome Extension (`chrome-extension/`)

```bash
npm run build   # production build → dist/
npm run watch   # auto-rebuild on change (then reload in chrome://extensions/)
```

---

## Architecture

### Request flow

```
Browser / Chrome Extension
    → React frontend (port 4000, dev proxy /api → 8000)
    → FastAPI backend (port 8000, prefix /api; Lambda + HTTP API in AWS)
    → DynamoDB (DynamoDB Local in Docker locally, DynamoDB in AWS)
```

### Backend (`backend/app/`)

- **`main.py`** — App factory: registers all routers via `EndpointRegistry`, adds CORS, rate-limiting, and error-handler middleware.
- **`api/endpoints/`** — One file per domain (`auth`, `users`, `car_generations`, `parts`, `build_lists`, `build_list_parts`, `build_list_phases`, `build_logs`, `votes`, `reports`, `images`, `search`, `admin`, `crawled_pages`, `part_manufacturers`, `categories`, `retailers`, `bug_reports`).
- **`db/dynamo/`** — DynamoDB layer: `tables.py` (every table and GSI, one `TableSpec` each), `repository.py` (generic `DynamoRepository[TModel]`), and one module per domain (`users`, `catalog`, `build_lists`, `build_logs`, `moderation`, ...) holding the Pydantic item models and their repositories. `api/dependencies/repositories.py` bundles them into the `Repositories` dependency.
- **`api/schemas/`** — Pydantic v2 request/response schemas.
- **`api/services/`** — Business logic layer called by endpoints.
- **`api/dependencies/auth.py`** — FastAPI `Depends()` helpers: `get_current_user`, `get_optional_current_user`, `get_current_admin_user`, `get_current_superuser`.
- **`api/middleware/`** — Rate limiting + content-length guard + error handlers.
- **`api/utils/`** — Shared patterns: `BaseDynamoEndpointRouter` (generic CRUD router over `BaseDynamoCRUDService`), `EndpointRegistry` (standardized router registration), pagination, authorization, subscription checks.
- **`core/`** — Config, logging, email templates (React Email HTML, sent via SES), car/category seed data.
- **`backend/app/core/sentry.py`** — Sentry SDK 2.x init helper. Env-gated (TESTING+APP_ENVIRONMENT+DSN). Scope processor reads request_id/user_id from log_context ContextVars.

**Auth:** JWT (HS256, configurable expiry 15 min–7 days per user preference) + bcrypt passwords + optional TOTP 2FA. Requires email verification before login is allowed. Email sent via AWS SES with IAM role auth.

**Images:** Uploaded to S3 (`carmodpicker-prod-user-images`, private) via boto3; presigned URLs used for serving. Pillow used for processing.

**Special endpoints:**
- `GET /health` — liveness check (always 200)
- `GET /ready` — readiness check (503 until DynamoDB answers a `DescribeTable` on the users table)

### Backend patterns

Endpoints read and write through repositories from `app/db/dynamo/`, injected via `get_repositories()`. Simple domains use `BaseDynamoEndpointRouter` (generic CRUD over `BaseDynamoCRUDService`) rather than hand-rolled route functions; when adding a new domain, add a `TableSpec`, an item model plus repository, and follow that pattern. Votes and reports are polymorphic over `entity_type` / `entity_id` and served by the unified `votes.py` / `reports.py` endpoints backed by `VoteService` / `ReportService` on DynamoDB.

### Frontend (`frontend/src/`)

- **`pages/`** — Route-level components (lazy-loaded).
- **`components/`** — Shared UI components.
- **`api/`** — Axios-based API client modules (one per backend domain).
- **`contexts/`** — React contexts (auth, user state).
- **`hooks/`** — Custom React hooks.
- React Router 7 for routing; Tailwind CSS 4 for styling.
- **Subscription tiers** gate features and ad display.

### Chrome Extension (`chrome-extension/src/`)

Content scripts scrape product data from retailer pages and POST to the backend API. Files that need an extension reload in `chrome://extensions/`: `manifest.json`, `background.ts`, `popup.html/css`. Content/popup/options scripts auto-update on next page load / popup reopen.

## Branching and deploys

```
feature/* ──PR──▶ staging ──PR──▶ main
                     │              │
                     ▼              ▼
           AWS 748861776298   AWS 734702670403
              (staging)          (production)
```

- Branch new work from `staging`, not `main`. PR into `staging`. Releasing is a PR from `staging` into `main` — that PR is the release boundary.
- Never commit directly to `main` or `staging`. Never force-push either. Stacked PRs bottom out on `staging`.
- Hotfixes branch from `main` and PR into `main`, then are immediately back-merged `main` → `staging`. Skipping the back-merge is how the branches silently diverge.
- Both accounts are `us-west-2`. Terraform Cloud org is `WebbPulse`.

**Protection is enforced by rulesets, with one bypass.** The WebbPulse org is on the GitHub Team plan, and repository rulesets cover both `main` and `staging`: pull request required, force-push and deletion blocked. The repository-admin role can bypass them, so the rulesets stop mistakes, not a determined admin. The real gate is Terraform Cloud manual apply on the production workspace: a merge cannot change AWS, only an apply can. CI runs on every PR but is not blocking — you have to read it.

### Workflows

Six workflows in `.github/workflows/`, three CI and three deploy, each scoped by path.

| Workflow | Trigger | Paths |
|---|---|---|
| `backend-ci.yml` | `pull_request` → `main` | `backend/**` |
| `frontend-ci.yml` | `pull_request` → `main` | `frontend/**` |
| `chrome-extension-ci.yml` | `pull_request` → `main` | `chrome-extension/**` |
| `backend-deploy.yml` | `push` → `main`, `staging` | `backend/**` |
| `frontend-deploy.yml` | `push` → `main`, `staging` | `frontend/**` |
| `chrome-extension-deploy.yml` | `push` → `main` | `chrome-extension/**` |

The three deploy workflows are fully independent — a backend merge never rebuilds the frontend.

`backend-deploy.yml` and `frontend-deploy.yml` pick their GitHub Environment from the branch (`main` → `production`, otherwise `staging`) and read every deploy-time value from that Environment. The backend deploy builds a Lambda zip (`requirements-lambda.txt` resolved for manylinux x86_64 / Python 3.13, plus `app/`), uploads it to the artifacts bucket keyed by commit SHA, waits for HCP Terraform to go idle, then runs `update-function-code` and `publish-version`.

**Still to change:** the three CI workflows only run on PRs into `main`; PRs into `staging` run no checks until `staging` is added to their `pull_request: branches:`.

**`chrome-extension-deploy.yml` stays `main`-only.** It publishes to the Chrome Web Store, not to AWS: patch-bump `manifest.json`, tag `chrome-extension-vX.Y.Z`, cut a GitHub Release, upload and publish the zip via the CWS API. A browser extension has no staging-account equivalent and there is no staging store listing, so a `staging` trigger would have nothing to deploy to. It is also the one sanctioned exception to "never commit directly to `main`" — it pushes its own version bump with `git push origin HEAD:main`.

### Environment-scoped variables

Deploy variables are **environment-scoped**: they live on the `production` and `staging` GitHub Environments, not the repository, so a `staging` push cannot silently pick up the production role. Nothing deploy-related is hardcoded in the workflows any more — the workspace id and the API URL are Environment variables too. Values come from the matching workspace's Terraform outputs (`terraform/README.md` maps each variable to its output). `VITE_API_URL` is `api_url`, which follows the served domain (`https://api.carmodpicker.com`, `https://api.staging.carmodpicker.com` once staging runs profile `full`), so it has to be re-copied when a profile flips; `frontend_url`, `domain_name`, `route53_zone_id` and `route53_zone_name_servers` are the other hostname-bearing outputs.

| Workflow | Variables | Secrets |
|---|---|---|
| `backend-deploy.yml` | `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`, `TFC_WORKSPACE_ID`, `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`, `LAMBDA_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET` | `TFC_API_TOKEN` |
| `frontend-deploy.yml` | `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`, `TFC_WORKSPACE_ID`, `FRONTEND_S3_BUCKET`, `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`, `VITE_API_URL`, `CWS_EXTENSION_ID` | `TFC_API_TOKEN` |
| `chrome-extension-deploy.yml` | `CWS_CLIENT_ID`, `CWS_EXTENSION_ID` | `CWS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CWS_REFRESH_TOKEN` |

The backend and frontend deploys poll the HCP Terraform runs API with `TFC_API_TOKEN` and wait for the workspace named by `TFC_WORKSPACE_ID` to reach a terminal state before touching Lambda or S3 — that poll is what stops a code update racing an in-flight configuration change. Production polls `ws-oh1VvpTBPxmcrSYD`; staging polls `CarModPicker-staging`.

### A staging branch does not imply staging infrastructure

`terraform/` is one root module applied by two HCP workspaces: `CarModPicker` (production, bound to `main`, pinned in the `cloud` block in `versions.tf`) and `CarModPicker-staging` (bound to `staging`, `environment = staging`). `var.environment` feeds `local.prefix`, `local.domain_name` and every environment-dependent decision.

The intended staging profile is `full`: the same stack as production, served as `staging.carmodpicker.com` / `www.staging.carmodpicker.com` / `api.staging.carmodpicker.com`. The staging account owns the `staging.carmodpicker.com` hosted zone, and the same apply writes its `NS` delegation into the `carmodpicker.com` zone in the production account through the `aws.parent_dns` provider alias, which assumes `route53_write_role_arn` (scoped to that one record) and targets `parent_route53_zone_id`. WebbPulse-Platform pushes both variables to the workspace; SES uses the domain identity exactly as production does. `reduced` is the fallback while those variables are absent: no custom domain, frontend on the CloudFront hostname, API on the `execute-api` endpoint, SES on a mailbox identity. `none` is rejected. Staging is never auto-provisioned to mirror production.

### The Lambda migration stack

Production was cut over from App Runner + RDS PostgreSQL to Lambda + DynamoDB on 2026-09-06 and the legacy stack has been destroyed; `terraform/README.md` keeps a short record under "Production cutover". The only remaining Postgres artefact is `backend/scripts/backfill_from_postgres.py`, kept for reference.

The Lambda's code is not Terraform's: the function is created from a placeholder zip with `ignore_changes` on the package, and `backend-deploy.yml` owns every update after that. Its secrets come from the `<prefix>/app` JSON secret, read at import by `backend/app/core/secrets.py` when `APP_SECRETS_ARN` is set. DynamoDB tables are declared once, in `backend/app/db/dynamo/tables.py`; `backend/scripts/export_dynamo_tables.py` renders them to `terraform/dynamodb_tables.json` and `tests/db/test_dynamo_tables_json_up_to_date.py` fails when the two drift.

---

## Key Conventions

- **Tables:** Declare every table and index in `backend/app/db/dynamo/tables.py`, then run `python scripts/export_dynamo_tables.py` so `terraform/dynamodb_tables.json` matches (a test fails when they drift). There are no migrations; schema changes are additive attributes on Pydantic item models.
- **pytest:** Always pass `-n auto` for parallel execution. Tests use moto's in-memory DynamoDB — no services required.
- **New CRUD endpoints:** Extend `BaseDynamoEndpointRouter` + `BaseDynamoCRUDService`; register with `EndpointRegistry` in `main.py`.
- The backend CORS config explicitly allows `chrome-extension://` origins and `null` (for service workers).
